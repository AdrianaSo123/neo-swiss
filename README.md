# Neo Swiss Design Style

This repository explains Neo Swiss design style and showcases its principles through a modern web implementation.

## About Neo Swiss Style

Neo Swiss style is a contemporary evolution of the classic Swiss Design (International Typographic Style) that emerged in Switzerland in the 1950s. It maintains the core principles of Swiss design while adapting them for modern digital media and contemporary aesthetics.

## Core Principles

- **Clarity and Readability**: Clean, legible typography with emphasis on hierarchy
- **Grid-Based Layout**: Systematic approach to organizing content
- **Minimal Color Palette**: Strategic use of color, often with bold accents
- **Geometric Precision**: Mathematical approach to spacing and proportions
- **Functional Design**: Form follows function with purposeful elements
